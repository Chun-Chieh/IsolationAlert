    <string name="text_training">On a dark winter night \n
        outside Elsinore Castle in Denmark,\n
        an officer named Bernardo comes to relieve the watchman Francisco. \n
        In the heavy darkness, \n
        the men cannot see each other. \n
        Bernardo hears a footstep near him and cries, \n
        ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs there?‚Äù \n
        After both men ensure that the other is also a watchman,\n
        they relax. Cold, tired, and apprehensive from his many hours of guarding the castle, \n
        Francisco thanks Bernardo and prepares to go home and go to bed.\n
        Shortly thereafter,\n
        Bernardo is joined by Marcellus, \n
        another watchman, and Horatio, a friend of Prince Hamlet.\n
        Bernardo and Marcellus have urged Horatio to stand watch with them,\n
        because they believe they have something shocking to show him. \n
        In hushed tones, \n
        they discuss the apparition they have seen for the past two nights, \n
        and which they now hope to show Horatio: \n
        the ghost of the recently deceased King Hamlet,\n
        which they claim has appeared before them on the castle ramparts \n
        in the late hours of the night.\n
        Horatio is skeptical,\n
        but then the ghost suddenly appears \n
        before the men and just as suddenly vanishes. \n
        Terrified, Horatio acknowledges \n
        that the specter does indeed resemble the dead King of Denmark, \n
        that it even wears the armor King Hamlet wore \n
        when he battled against the armies of Norway, \n
        and the same frown he wore when he fought against the Poles.\n
        Horatio declares that the ghost must bring warning of impending misfortune for Denmark,\n
        perhaps in the form of a military attack.\n
        He recounts the story of King Hamlet‚Äôs conquest \n
        of certain lands once belonging to Norway, \n
        saying that Fortinbras, \n
        the young Prince of Norway,\n
        now seeks to reconquer those forfeited lands.\n
        The ghost materializes for a second time,\n
        and Horatio tries to speak to it. \n
        The ghost remains silent, however, \n
        and disappears again just as the cock crows at the first hint of dawn.\n
        Horatio suggests that they tell Prince Hamlet, \n
        the dead king‚Äôs son, about the apparition. \n
        He believes that though the ghost did not speak to him,\n
        if it is really the ghost of King Hamlet, \n
        it will not refuse to speak to his beloved son.\n</string>
